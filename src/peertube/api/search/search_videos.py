    """Search for videos on the PeerTube instance asynchronously with detailed response information.

    Performs an asynchronous video search on the PeerTube instance using various filtering criteria.
    If the user can make a remote URI search and the search string is a URI, the PeerTube instance
    will fetch the remote object and add it to its database for interaction via the REST API.

    Args:
        client: The authenticated or unauthenticated client for making requests.
        search: String to search for. Can be a video title, description, or URI.
        uuids: Filter results to specific video UUIDs.
        search_target: Whether to search locally or use search index. If search index is enabled
            by the administrator, you can override the default search target.
        start: Starting index for pagination (0-based).
        count: Maximum number of videos to return per page. Default: 15.
        skip_count: Whether to skip the total count calculation for performance.
        sort: Sort videos by criteria. Can be a string (e.g., "-publishedAt") or SearchVideosSort enum. Prefix with `-` for descending order. Options include:
            `hot` (Reddit-like algorithm considering views, likes, dislikes, comments, and date),
            `best` (like hot but includes user history), `trending` (recent views),
            `views` (total view count), `publishedAt` (publication date).
        nsfw: Filter for NSFW content (show all, only NSFW, or only safe content).
        nsfw_flags_included: Include videos with specific NSFW flags. Can be combined with
            bitwise OR: 0=NONE, 1=VIOLENT, 2=EXPLICIT_SEX.
        nsfw_flags_excluded: Exclude videos with specific NSFW flags. Can be combined with
            bitwise OR: 0=NONE, 1=VIOLENT, 2=EXPLICIT_SEX.
        is_live: Filter for live videos only.
        include_scheduled_live: Include scheduled live videos in results.
        category_one_of: Filter by video category IDs. Can be a single ID or list of IDs.
        licence_one_of: Filter by video licence IDs. Can be a single ID or list of IDs.
        language_one_of: Filter by language codes. Can be a single language or list of languages.
        tags_one_of: Filter videos that have at least one of the specified tags.
        tags_all_of: Filter videos that have all of the specified tags.
        is_local: Filter for local videos only (hosted on this instance).
        include: Include additional video information in results. Administrators and moderators
            only. Can be combined with bitwise OR: 0=NONE, 1=NOT_PUBLISHED_STATE, 2=BLACKLISTED,
            4=BLOCKED_OWNER, 8=FILES, 16=CAPTIONS, 32=VIDEO_SOURCE.
        has_hls_files: Filter for videos that have HLS streaming files.
        has_web_video_files: Filter for videos that have web-compatible video files.
        host: Filter by the hostname where videos are hosted.
        auto_tag_one_of: Filter by automatically generated tags.
        privacy_one_of: Filter by video privacy settings (public, unlisted, private, internal).
        exclude_already_watched: Exclude videos that the current user has already watched.
        start_date: Filter for videos published after this date.
        end_date: Filter for videos published before this date.
        originally_published_start_date: Filter for videos originally published after this date.
        originally_published_end_date: Filter for videos originally published before this date.
        duration_min: Filter for videos with at least this duration (in seconds).
        duration_max: Filter for videos with at most this duration (in seconds).

    Raises:
        errors.UnexpectedStatus: If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
        httpx.TimeoutException: If the request takes longer than Client.timeout.
