    "description": "The PeerTube API is built on HTTP(S) and is RESTful. You can use your favorite\nHTTP/REST library for your programming language to use PeerTube.\n\nSee the [REST API quick start](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api/rest-getting-started) for a few\nexamples of using the PeerTube API.\n\n# Authentication\n\nWhen you sign up for an account on a PeerTube instance, you are given the possibility\nto generate sessions on it, and authenticate there using an access token. Only __one\naccess token can currently be used at a time__.\n\n## Roles\n\nAccounts are given permissions based on their role. There are three roles on\nPeerTube: Administrator, Moderator, and User. See the [roles guide](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/admin/managing-users#roles) for a detail of their permissions.\n\n# Errors\n\nThe API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure\nof the API call, completed by a [RFC7807-compliant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) response body.\n\n```\nHTTP 1.1 404 Not Found\nContent-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8\n\n{\n  \"detail\": \"Video not found\",\n  \"docs\": \"https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html#operation/getVideo\",\n  \"status\": 404,\n  \"title\": \"Not Found\",\n  \"type\": \"about:blank\"\n}\n```\n\nWe provide error `type` (following RFC7807) and `code` (internal PeerTube code) values for [a growing number of cases](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/blob/develop/packages/models/src/server/server-error-code.enum.ts),\nbut it is still optional. Types are used to disambiguate errors that bear the same status code\nand are non-obvious:\n\n```\nHTTP 1.1 403 Forbidden\nContent-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8\n\n{\n  \"detail\": \"Cannot get this video regarding follow constraints\",\n  \"docs\": \"https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html#operation/getVideo\",\n  \"status\": 403,\n  \"title\": \"Forbidden\",\n  \"type\": \"https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html#section/Errors/does_not_respect_follow_constraints\"\n}\n```\n\nHere a 403 error could otherwise mean that the video is private or blocklisted.\n\n### Validation errors\n\nEach parameter is evaluated on its own against a set of rules before the route validator\nproceeds with potential testing involving parameter combinations. Errors coming from validation\nerrors appear earlier and benefit from a more detailed error description:\n\n```\nHTTP 1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8\n\n{\n  \"detail\": \"Incorrect request parameters: id\",\n  \"docs\": \"https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html#operation/getVideo\",\n  \"instance\": \"/api/v1/videos/9c9de5e8-0a1e-484a-b099-e80766180\",\n  \"invalid-params\": {\n    \"id\": {\n      \"location\": \"params\",\n      \"msg\": \"Invalid value\",\n      \"param\": \"id\",\n      \"value\": \"9c9de5e8-0a1e-484a-b099-e80766180\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"status\": 400,\n  \"title\": \"Bad Request\",\n  \"type\": \"about:blank\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere `id` is the name of the field concerned by the error, within the route definition.\n`invalid-params.<field>.location` can be either 'params', 'body', 'header', 'query' or 'cookies', and\n`invalid-params.<field>.value` reports the value that didn't pass validation whose `invalid-params.<field>.msg`\nis about.\n\n### Deprecated error fields\n\nSome fields could be included with previous versions. They are still included but their use is deprecated:\n- `error`: superseded by `detail`\n\n# Rate limits\n\nWe are rate-limiting all endpoints of PeerTube's API. Custom values can be set by administrators:\n\n| Endpoint (prefix: `/api/v1`) | Calls         | Time frame   |\n|------------------------------|---------------|--------------|\n| `/*`                         | 50            | 10 seconds   |\n| `POST /users/token`          | 15            | 5 minutes    |\n| `POST /users/register`       | 2<sup>*</sup> | 5 minutes    |\n| `POST /users/ask-send-verify-email` | 3      | 5 minutes    |\n\nDepending on the endpoint, <sup>*</sup>failed requests are not taken into account. A service\nlimit is announced by a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.\n\nYou can get details about the current state of your rate limit by reading the\nfollowing headers:\n\n| Header                  | Description                                                |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | Number of max requests allowed in the current time period  |\n| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Number of remaining requests in the current time period    |\n| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | Timestamp of end of current time period as UNIX timestamp  |\n| `Retry-After`           | Seconds to delay after the first `429` is received         |\n\n# CORS\n\nThis API features [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/),\nallowing cross-domain communication from the browser for some routes:\n\n| Endpoint                    |\n|------------------------- ---|\n| `/api/*`                    |\n| `/download/*`               |\n| `/lazy-static/*`            |\n| `/.well-known/webfinger`    |\n\nIn addition, all routes serving ActivityPub are CORS-enabled for all origins.\n"

Its protocol lets\nyou resume an upload operation after a network interruption or other transmission failure,\nsaving time and bandwidth in the event of network failures.\n\nFavor using resumable uploads in any of the following cases:\n- You are transferring large files\n- The likelihood of a network interruption is high\n- Uploads are originating from a device with a low-bandwidth or unstable Internet connection,\n  such as a mobile device\n\n### Import\n\n- _URL_-based: where the URL points to any service supported by [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/)\n- _magnet_-based: where the URI resolves to a BitTorrent resource containing a single supported video file\n- _torrent_-based: where the metainfo file resolves to a BitTorrent resource containing a single supported video file\n\nThe import function is practical when the desired video/audio is available online. It makes PeerTube\ndownload it for you, saving you as much bandwidth and avoiding any instability or limitation your network might have.\n"

Des affrontements avec les forces de l’ordre ont éclaté près du lycée Hélène Boucher, à la gare du Nord et surtout à Châtelet-les-Halles, épicentre de la journée. Malgré la mobilisation de 80 000 policiers et gendarmes, les cortèges ont exprimé un mot d’ordre commun : s’unir face à la politique austère du gouvernement. Beaucoup voient dans cette journée le point de départ d’un mouvement appelé à durer.</p>\n<p>Journaliste : Hamza Chennaf<br />\nImages : Jose Rexach, Thibault Izoret, Clara Menais<br />\nMontage :

Le 8 septembre 2025, pour la seconde fois en 9 mois, le gouvernement nommé par Emmanuel Macron a perdu la confiance de l’Assemblée nationale. Les résultats sont sans appel et le président de la République a rapidement réagi : il a annoncé qu’il nommerait quelqu’un dans les tout prochains jours. La séquence politique est une fois de plus difficile à comprendre, depuis qu’Emmanuel Macron a dissous l’Assemblée nationale, il y a plus d’un an. L’incertitude politique et institutionnelle a rarement été aussi importante ! Alors que s’est-il passé exactement ce 8 septembre, qu’est-ce que ça veut dire pour notre pays, et surtout, qu’est-ce qui nous attend dans les prochaines semaines ? Aujourd’hui on vous propose de comprendre la situation politique de la France, dans cette émission spéciale pour Blast !</p>\n<p>Une vidéo de Salomé Saqué, Camille Chastrusse et Victor-Ulysse Sultra,

I have a couple of very small, but hard fought patches in the NetBSD kernel. It's not over yet, either. I still have a few bugs around the compositor shutdown process and a lot of integration work to be able to hope to have other people try this out.</p>\n<p>Topics to cover in the talk include (but are not limited to):</p>\nHistory of Wayland and other background info\n\nHow your graphics stack and driver is organized and actually works\n\nThe actual porting journey on both NetBSD and OpenBSD\n\nA Demo! I should be able to show it running\n\nCurrent status, future work\n\n<p>For more information, please visit:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener

We truly live in the future where we can finally reject complicated caching and fully embrace the unbuffered conversations with our disks. Or can we really?</p>\n<p>Those of you who know a bit about ZFS know that the ARC is actually pretty important (without one ZFS would historically stand for zzz 😴 instead of Zetta). How could it be then that skipping the ARC might improve performance?</p>\n<p>During the presentation we will discuss what workloads and setups benefit from direct IO, what its limitations are, and what pitfalls to avoid during benchmarking. We will also look at the implementation to understand how all the promises of stability and compatibility were kept.</p>\n<p>Direct IO is reported to deliver amazing performance boosts in some deployments. Understanding how not to hold it wrong is a great first step to potentially unlocking that speed-up on your systems too!</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit:<br />\n<a

Another issue we identified is that University labs rarely teach problem-solving skills for a real-world scenario that students have to deal with in their post-academic working life (i.e. fixing production issues). Traditional assignments lacked real-world relevance (and were easily solved with the help of AI), leaving students unprepared for professional challenges in their later jobs. To address this, we developed as part of a master's thesis for University of Applied Sciences, Darmstadt, Germany a new teaching framework leveraging Chaos Engineering and Gamification elements to modernize Unix education on FreeBSD. With our new system, real-world problems can be simulated by instructors and allows students to use system administrator permissions to solve them. We also developed this system to make it difficult for participants to \"cheat\" using AI and evaluated the system towards that end with a group of students.</p>\n<p>This talk will introduce our new \"Chaos education system\" tested in the \"Unix for Software Developers\" course at the University. The name stems from the chaos monkey systems that intentionally \"wreak havoc\" on production systems to improve their resiliency and train the sysadmins managing them to find and fix them. Our approach lets instructors inject intentional faults (error scenarios) into student-managed FreeBSD jails. The students must then identify, resolve, and prevent these issues from occurring again using standard system administration tools, including root permissions. To increase student motivation to solve these scenarios quickly (and to create artificial \"production system is at stake\" pressure), a global highscore list is used as a gamification element: each time an issue is solved, points are awarded to that team based on the elapsed time and an instructor-defined difficulty bonus. A post-mortem group discussion with the instructor lets students talk through various ways of solving the issue, giving the group deeper insights on possible solutions each group had used. Using the system, the students gain practical skills like troubleshooting, system recovery, and proactive system management with real-world scenarios, something that traditional \"one size fits all\" assignments lack.</p>\n<p>We built the whole system using BSD-licensed open source components: FreeBSD, pf, VNET, bastille jails and templates. Shells scripts act as the glue to tie them together and implement the logic for the rest of the chaos monkey system. The prototype system has been tested with two student groups of 16 students each in January 2025. One group was allowed to use ChatGPT during the scenarios to see how AI-support helps them (if at all). Insights from this testing was used to enhance the system further.</p>\n<p>This talk will introduce the chaos education system idea, implementation, demonstrate its functionality, and discuss future work in this area. FreeBSD proved to be an excellent building platform for this system, due to its great modularity, open source, low resource overhead, and available documentation. The system can be enhanced further and used outside of an academic environment, like employee training or workshop-style challenges at events. It is easy for instructors to construct a custom scenario for participants and inject it into the training jails. The system can scale to a number of parallel users due to the lightweight nature that FreeBSD jails provide.</p>\n<p>Audience: Educators, trainers, and system administrators interested in modernizing Unix/Linux education through hands-on, interactive methods. Managers may find the system interesting for training their own employees by constructing scenarios mimicking their own environment.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit:<br />\n<a

Bug reporting, code proposing, and event participation are fundamental elements of the BSD Unix community and despite appearances, are open to anyone to participate.</p>\n<p>This talk will take a pragmatic tour of effective engagement on these topics with real-world examples and tips for:</p>\nBug reports that are actionable and inspire attention\n\nCode change requests and reviews that are more likely to review and acceptance\n\nConference proposals that stand out, accurately set expectations, and are more likely to be accepted\n\n<p>The secret is that all of that all of these are fundamentally indistinguishable: You are tasked with marketing your idea to others and must show your work, justify your points, demonstrate sincerity, and ultimately convince others of your initiative, regardless of its size.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener

This talk will go through the various components of sound(4) that make sound possible on FreeBSD, that is:</p>\nThe generic driver's structure, control flow and interaction with the device drivers.\n\nThe audio processing chain.\n\nThe user-facing interfaces for interacting with the sound system.\n\n<p>The talk will also mention some notable recent, ongoing and future work across the whole sound system, since my taking over of its development.</p>\n<p>I also intend to showcase examples of:</p>\nAudio driver and application develpoment on FreeBSD.\n\nFreeBSD being used for music production, and why a musician would consider it instead of other operating systems.\n\n<p>(I may have to leave one or both of these out to keep the talk to the desired duration)</p>\n<p>For more

In this presentation, I will discuss the reasons behind our decision, the technical and organizational challenges we faced, the tangible benefits we have experienced, and why we believe this migration is successful. I will provide specific examples and real-life case studies. In an increasingly complex world, relying on simple, stable, and secure solutions is becoming more and more important, and the BSDs can make a significant contribution in this direction.</p>\n<p>For

(These are not BSD-specific topics, but the maturity of reasonable routing daemons in ports have meant that we can now do this without needing an upstream router).</p>\n<p>For more information, please

Des affrontements avec les forces de l’ordre ont éclaté près du lycée Hélène Boucher, à la gare du Nord et surtout à Châtelet-les-Halles, épicentre de la journée. Malgré la mobilisation de 80 000 policiers et gendarmes, les cortèges ont exprimé un mot d’ordre commun : s’unir face à la politique austère du gouvernement. Beaucoup voient dans cette journée le point de départ d’un mouvement appelé à durer.</p>\n<p>Journaliste : Hamza Chennaf<br />\nImages : Jose Rexach, Thibault Izoret, Clara Menais<br />\nMontage :

Le 8 septembre 2025, pour la seconde fois en 9 mois, le gouvernement nommé par Emmanuel Macron a perdu la confiance de l’Assemblée nationale. Les résultats sont sans appel et le président de la République a rapidement réagi : il a annoncé qu’il nommerait quelqu’un dans les tout prochains jours. La séquence politique est une fois de plus difficile à comprendre, depuis qu’Emmanuel Macron a dissous l’Assemblée nationale, il y a plus d’un an. L’incertitude politique et institutionnelle a rarement été aussi importante ! Alors que s’est-il passé exactement ce 8 septembre, qu’est-ce que ça veut dire pour notre pays, et surtout, qu’est-ce qui nous attend dans les prochaines semaines ? Aujourd’hui on vous propose de comprendre la situation politique de la France, dans cette émission spéciale pour Blast !</p>\n<p>Une vidéo de Salomé Saqué, Camille Chastrusse et Victor-Ulysse Sultra,

I have a couple of very small, but hard fought patches in the NetBSD kernel. It's not over yet, either. I still have a few bugs around the compositor shutdown process and a lot of integration work to be able to hope to have other people try this out.</p>\n<p>Topics to cover in the talk include (but are not limited to):</p>\nHistory of Wayland and other background info\n\nHow your graphics stack and driver is organized and actually works\n\nThe actual porting journey on both NetBSD and OpenBSD\n\nA Demo!

We truly live in the future where we can finally reject complicated caching and fully embrace the unbuffered conversations with our disks. Or can we really?</p>\n<p>Those of you who know a bit about ZFS know that the ARC is actually pretty important (without one ZFS would historically stand for zzz 😴 instead of Zetta). How could it be then that skipping the ARC might improve performance?</p>\n<p>During the presentation we will discuss what workloads and setups benefit from direct IO, what its limitations are, and what pitfalls to avoid during benchmarking. We will also look at the implementation to understand how all the promises of stability and compatibility were kept.</p>\n<p>Direct IO is reported to deliver amazing performance boosts in some deployments. Understanding how not to hold it wrong is a great first step to potentially unlocking that speed-up on your systems too!</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit:<br />\n<a

Another issue we identified is that University labs rarely teach problem-solving skills for a real-world scenario that students have to deal with in their post-academic working life (i.e. fixing production issues). Traditional assignments lacked real-world relevance (and were easily solved with the help of AI), leaving students unprepared for professional challenges in their later jobs. To address this, we developed as part of a master's thesis for University of Applied Sciences, Darmstadt, Germany a new teaching framework leveraging Chaos Engineering and Gamification elements to modernize Unix education on FreeBSD. With our new system, real-world problems can be simulated by instructors and allows students to use system administrator permissions to solve them. We also developed this system to make it difficult for participants to \"cheat\" using AI and evaluated the system towards that end with a group of students.</p>\n<p>This talk will introduce our new \"Chaos education system\" tested in the \"Unix for Software Developers\" course at the University. The name stems from the chaos monkey systems that intentionally \"wreak havoc\" on production systems to improve their resiliency and train the sysadmins managing them to find and fix them. Our approach lets instructors inject intentional faults (error scenarios) into student-managed FreeBSD jails. The students must then identify, resolve, and prevent these issues from occurring again using standard system administration tools, including root permissions. To increase student motivation to solve these scenarios quickly (and to create artificial \"production system is at stake\" pressure), a global highscore list is used as a gamification element: each time an issue is solved, points are awarded to that team based on the elapsed time and an instructor-defined difficulty bonus. A post-mortem group discussion with the instructor lets students talk through various ways of solving the issue, giving the group deeper insights on possible solutions each group had used. Using the system, the students gain practical skills like troubleshooting, system recovery, and proactive system management with real-world scenarios, something that traditional \"one size fits all\" assignments lack.</p>\n<p>We built the whole system using BSD-licensed open source components: FreeBSD, pf, VNET, bastille jails and templates. Shells scripts act as the glue to tie them together and implement the logic for the rest of the chaos monkey system. The prototype system has been tested with two student groups of 16 students each in January 2025. One group was allowed to use ChatGPT during the scenarios to see how AI-support helps them (if at all). Insights from this testing was used to enhance the system further.</p>\n<p>This talk will introduce the chaos education system idea, implementation, demonstrate its functionality, and discuss future work in this area. FreeBSD proved to be an excellent building platform for this system, due to its great modularity, open source, low resource overhead, and available documentation. The system can be enhanced further and used outside of an academic environment, like employee training or workshop-style challenges at events. It is easy for instructors to construct a custom scenario for participants and inject it into the training jails. The system can scale to a number of parallel users due to the lightweight nature that FreeBSD jails provide.</p>\n<p>Audience: Educators, trainers, and system administrators interested in modernizing Unix/Linux education through hands-on, interactive methods. Managers may find the system interesting for training their own employees by constructing scenarios mimicking their own environment.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit:<br />\n<a

Bug reporting, code proposing, and event participation are fundamental elements of the BSD Unix community and despite appearances, are open to anyone to participate.</p>\n<p>This talk will take a pragmatic tour of effective engagement on these topics with real-world examples and tips for:</p>\nBug reports that are actionable and inspire attention\n\nCode change requests and reviews that are more likely to review and acceptance\n\nConference proposals that stand out, accurately set expectations, and are more likely to be accepted\n\n<p>The secret is that all of that all of these are fundamentally indistinguishable: You are tasked with marketing your idea to others and must show your work, justify your points, demonstrate sincerity, and ultimately convince others of your initiative, regardless of its size.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener

In this presentation, I will discuss the reasons behind our decision, the technical and organizational challenges we faced, the tangible benefits we have experienced, and why we believe this migration is successful. I will provide specific examples and real-life case studies. In an increasingly complex world, relying on simple, stable, and secure solutions is becoming more and more important, and the BSDs can make a significant contribution in this direction.</p>\n<p>For

(These are not BSD-specific topics, but the maturity of reasonable routing daemons in ports have meant that we can now do this without needing an upstream router).</p>\n<p>For more information, please

Des affrontements avec les forces de l’ordre ont éclaté près du lycée Hélène Boucher, à la gare du Nord et surtout à Châtelet-les-Halles, épicentre de la journée. Malgré la mobilisation de 80 000 policiers et gendarmes, les cortèges ont exprimé un mot d’ordre commun : s’unir face à la politique austère du gouvernement. Beaucoup voient dans cette journée le point de départ d’un mouvement appelé à durer.</p>\n<p>Journaliste : Hamza Chennaf<br />\nImages : Jose Rexach, Thibault Izoret, Clara Menais<br />\nMontage :

Le 8 septembre 2025, pour la seconde fois en 9 mois, le gouvernement nommé par Emmanuel Macron a perdu la confiance de l’Assemblée nationale. Les résultats sont sans appel et le président de la République a rapidement réagi : il a annoncé qu’il nommerait quelqu’un dans les tout prochains jours. La séquence politique est une fois de plus difficile à comprendre, depuis qu’Emmanuel Macron a dissous l’Assemblée nationale, il y a plus d’un an. L’incertitude politique et institutionnelle a rarement été aussi importante ! Alors que s’est-il passé exactement ce 8 septembre, qu’est-ce que ça veut dire pour notre pays, et surtout, qu’est-ce qui nous attend dans les prochaines semaines ? Aujourd’hui on vous propose de comprendre la situation politique de la France, dans cette émission spéciale pour Blast !</p>\n<p>Une vidéo de Salomé Saqué, Camille Chastrusse et Victor-Ulysse Sultra,

I have a couple of very small, but hard fought patches in the NetBSD kernel. It's not over yet, either. I still have a few bugs around the compositor shutdown process and a lot of integration work to be able to hope to have other people try this out.</p>\n<p>Topics to cover in the talk include (but are not limited to):</p>\nHistory of Wayland and other background info\n\nHow your graphics stack and driver is organized and actually works\n\nThe actual porting journey on both NetBSD and OpenBSD\n\nA Demo! I should be able to show it running\n\nCurrent status, future work\n\n<p>For more information, please visit:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener

We truly live in the future where we can finally reject complicated caching and fully embrace the unbuffered conversations with our disks. Or can we really?</p>\n<p>Those of you who know a bit about ZFS know that the ARC is actually pretty important (without one ZFS would historically stand for zzz 😴 instead of Zetta). How could it be then that skipping the ARC might improve performance?</p>\n<p>During the presentation we will discuss what workloads and setups benefit from direct IO, what its limitations are, and what pitfalls to avoid during benchmarking. We will also look at the implementation to understand how all the promises of stability and compatibility were kept.</p>\n<p>Direct IO is reported to deliver amazing performance boosts in some deployments. Understanding how not to hold it wrong is a great first step to potentially unlocking that speed-up on your systems too!</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit:<br />\n<a

Another issue we identified is that University labs rarely teach problem-solving skills for a real-world scenario that students have to deal with in their post-academic working life (i.e. fixing production issues). Traditional assignments lacked real-world relevance (and were easily solved with the help of AI), leaving students unprepared for professional challenges in their later jobs. To address this, we developed as part of a master's thesis for University of Applied Sciences, Darmstadt, Germany a new teaching framework leveraging Chaos Engineering and Gamification elements to modernize Unix education on FreeBSD. With our new system, real-world problems can be simulated by instructors and allows students to use system administrator permissions to solve them. We also developed this system to make it difficult for participants to \"cheat\" using AI and evaluated the system towards that end with a group of students.</p>\n<p>This talk will introduce our new \"Chaos education system\" tested in the \"Unix for Software Developers\" course at the University. The name stems from the chaos monkey systems that intentionally \"wreak havoc\" on production systems to improve their resiliency and train the sysadmins managing them to find and fix them. Our approach lets instructors inject intentional faults (error scenarios) into student-managed FreeBSD jails. The students must then identify, resolve, and prevent these issues from occurring again using standard system administration tools, including root permissions. To increase student motivation to solve these scenarios quickly (and to create artificial \"production system is at stake\" pressure), a global highscore list is used as a gamification element: each time an issue is solved, points are awarded to that team based on the elapsed time and an instructor-defined difficulty bonus. A post-mortem group discussion with the instructor lets students talk through various ways of solving the issue, giving the group deeper insights on possible solutions each group had used. Using the system, the students gain practical skills like troubleshooting, system recovery, and proactive system management with real-world scenarios, something that traditional \"one size fits all\" assignments lack.</p>\n<p>We built the whole system using BSD-licensed open source components: FreeBSD, pf, VNET, bastille jails and templates. Shells scripts act as the glue to tie them together and implement the logic for the rest of the chaos monkey system. The prototype system has been tested with two student groups of 16 students each in January 2025. One group was allowed to use ChatGPT during the scenarios to see how AI-support helps them (if at all). Insights from this testing was used to enhance the system further.</p>\n<p>This talk will introduce the chaos education system idea, implementation, demonstrate its functionality, and discuss future work in this area. FreeBSD proved to be an excellent building platform for this system, due to its great modularity, open source, low resource overhead, and available documentation. The system can be enhanced further and used outside of an academic environment, like employee training or workshop-style challenges at events. It is easy for instructors to construct a custom scenario for participants and inject it into the training jails. The system can scale to a number of parallel users due to the lightweight nature that FreeBSD jails provide.</p>\n<p>Audience: Educators, trainers, and system administrators interested in modernizing Unix/Linux education through hands-on, interactive methods. Managers may find the system interesting for training their own employees by constructing scenarios mimicking their own environment.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit:<br />\n<a

Bug reporting, code proposing, and event participation are fundamental elements of the BSD Unix community and despite appearances, are open to anyone to participate.</p>\n<p>This talk will take a pragmatic tour of effective engagement on these topics with real-world examples and tips for:</p>\nBug reports that are actionable and inspire attention\n\nCode change requests and reviews that are more likely to review and acceptance\n\nConference proposals that stand out, accurately set expectations, and are more likely to be accepted\n\n<p>The secret is that all of that all of these are fundamentally indistinguishable: You are tasked with marketing your idea to others and must show your work, justify your points, demonstrate sincerity, and ultimately convince others of your initiative, regardless of its size.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener

This talk will go through the various components of sound(4) that make sound possible on FreeBSD, that is:</p>\nThe generic driver's structure, control flow and interaction with the device drivers.\n\nThe audio processing chain.\n\nThe user-facing interfaces for interacting with the sound system.\n\n<p>The talk will also mention some notable recent, ongoing and future work across the whole sound system, since my taking over of its development.</p>\n<p>I also intend to showcase examples of:</p>\nAudio driver and application develpoment on FreeBSD.\n\nFreeBSD being used for music production, and why a musician would consider it instead of other operating systems.\n\n<p>(I may have to leave one or both of these out to keep the talk to the desired duration)</p>\n<p>For more

In this presentation, I will discuss the reasons behind our decision, the technical and organizational challenges we faced, the tangible benefits we have experienced, and why we believe this migration is successful. I will provide specific examples and real-life case studies. In an increasingly complex world, relying on simple, stable, and secure solutions is becoming more and more important, and the BSDs can make a significant contribution in this direction.</p>\n<p>For

(These are not BSD-specific topics, but the maturity of reasonable routing daemons in ports have meant that we can now do this without needing an upstream router).</p>\n<p>For more information, please

Des affrontements avec les forces de l’ordre ont éclaté près du lycée Hélène Boucher, à la gare du Nord et surtout à Châtelet-les-Halles, épicentre de la journée. Malgré la mobilisation de 80 000 policiers et gendarmes, les cortèges ont exprimé un mot d’ordre commun : s’unir face à la politique austère du gouvernement.

Le 8 septembre 2025, pour la seconde fois en 9 mois, le gouvernement nommé par Emmanuel Macron a perdu la confiance de l’Assemblée nationale. Les résultats sont sans appel et le président de la République a rapidement réagi : il a annoncé qu’il nommerait quelqu’un dans les tout prochains jours. La séquence politique est une fois de plus difficile à comprendre, depuis qu’Emmanuel Macron a dissous l’Assemblée nationale, il y a plus d’un an. L’incertitude politique et institutionnelle a rarement été aussi importante ! Alors que s’est-il passé exactement ce 8 septembre, qu’est-ce que ça veut dire pour notre pays, et surtout, qu’est-ce qui nous attend dans les prochaines semaines ?

Another issue we identified is that University labs rarely teach problem-solving skills for a real-world scenario that students have to deal with in their post-academic working life (i.e. fixing production issues). Traditional assignments lacked real-world relevance (and were easily solved with the help of AI), leaving students unprepared for professional challenges in their later jobs. To address this, we developed as part of a master's thesis for University of Applied Sciences, Darmstadt, Germany a new teaching framework leveraging Chaos Engineering and Gamification elements to modernize Unix education on FreeBSD. With our new system, real-world problems can be simulated by instructors and allows students to use system administrator permissions to solve them. We also developed this system to make it difficult for participants to \"cheat\" using AI and evaluated the system towards that end with a group of students.</p>\n<p>This talk will introduce our new \"Chaos education system\" tested in the \"Unix for Software Developers\" course at the University. The name stems from the chaos monkey systems that intentionally \"wreak havoc\" on production systems to improve their resiliency and train the sysadmins managing them to find and fix them. Our approach lets instructors inject intentional faults (error scenarios) into student-managed FreeBSD jails. The students must then identify, resolve, and prevent these issues from occurring again using standard system administration tools, including root permissions. To increase student motivation to solve these scenarios quickly (and to create artificial \"production system is at stake\" pressure), a global highscore list is used as a gamification element: each time an issue is solved, points are awarded to that team based on the elapsed time and an instructor-defined difficulty bonus. A post-mortem group discussion with the instructor lets students talk through various ways of solving the issue, giving the group deeper insights on possible solutions each group had used. Using the system, the students gain practical skills like troubleshooting, system recovery, and proactive system management with real-world scenarios, something that traditional \"one size fits all\" assignments lack.</p>\n<p>We built the whole system using BSD-licensed open source components: FreeBSD, pf, VNET, bastille jails and templates. Shells scripts act as the glue to tie them together and implement the logic for the rest of the chaos monkey system. The prototype system has been tested with two student groups of 16 students each in January 2025. One group was allowed to use ChatGPT during the scenarios to see how AI-support helps them (if at all). Insights from this testing was used to enhance the system further.</p>\n<p>This talk will introduce the chaos education system idea, implementation, demonstrate its functionality, and discuss future work in this area. FreeBSD proved to be an excellent building platform for this system, due to its great modularity, open source, low resource overhead, and available documentation. The system can be enhanced further and used outside of an academic environment, like employee training or workshop-style challenges at events. It is easy for instructors to construct a custom scenario for participants and inject it into the training jails. The system can scale to a number of parallel users due to the lightweight nature that FreeBSD jails provide.</p>\n<p>Audience: Educators, trainers, and system administrators interested in modernizing Unix/Linux education through hands-on, interactive methods. Managers may find the system interesting for training their own employees by constructing scenarios mimicking their own environment.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>and -<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/timetable/timetable-Enhancing-Unix-Education.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/timetable/timetable-Enhancing-Unix-Education.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n]]></content>\n        <author>\n            <name>BSDTV</name>\n            <uri>https://peertube2.cpy.re/c/bsdtv@toobnix.org/videos</uri>\n        </author>\n        <category label=\"Science &amp; Technology\"/>\n    </entry>\n    <entry>\n        <title type=\"html\"><![CDATA[Effective Bug Reports, Code Change Requests, and Conference Proposals by  Michael Dexter]]></title>\n        <id>https://peertube2.cpy.re/w/kQKyuttv2fSVBznH8oKd6Q</id>\n        <link href=\"https://peertube2.cpy.re/w/kQKyuttv2fSVBznH8oKd6Q\"/>\n        <updated>2025-09-09T03:42:33.993Z</updated>\n        <summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[Effective Bug Reports, Code Change Requests, and Conference Proposals by  Michael Dexter Open Source is participatory and BSD Unix is no exception, with its own unique development workflows and events.

Des affrontements avec les forces de l’ordre ont éclaté près du lycée Hélène Boucher, à la gare du Nord et surtout à Châtelet-les-Halles, épicentre de la journée. Malgré la mobilisation de 80 000 policiers et gendarmes, les cortèges ont exprimé un mot d’ordre commun : s’unir face à la politique austère du gouvernement.

Le 8 septembre 2025, pour la seconde fois en 9 mois, le gouvernement nommé par Emmanuel Macron a perdu la confiance de l’Assemblée nationale. Les résultats sont sans appel et le président de la République a rapidement réagi : il a annoncé qu’il nommerait quelqu’un dans les tout prochains jours. La séquence politique est une fois de plus difficile à comprendre, depuis qu’Emmanuel Macron a dissous l’Assemblée nationale, il y a plus d’un an. L’incertitude politique et institutionnelle a rarement été aussi importante ! Alors que s’est-il passé exactement ce 8 septembre, qu’est-ce que ça veut dire pour notre pays, et surtout, qu’est-ce qui nous attend dans les prochaines semaines ?

I should be able to show it running\n\nCurrent status, future work\n\n<p>For more information, please visit:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>and -<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/timetable/timetable-Adventures-in-porting.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/timetable/timetable-Adventures-in-porting.html</a><br />\n#wayland #runbbsd #openbsd #netbsd</li>\n</ul>\n",

We truly live in the future where we can finally reject complicated caching and fully embrace the unbuffered conversations with our disks. Or can we really?</p>\n<p>Those of you who know a bit about ZFS know that the ARC is actually pretty important (without one ZFS would historically stand for zzz 😴 instead of Zetta). How could it be then that skipping the ARC might improve performance?</p>\n<p>During the presentation we will discuss what workloads and setups benefit from direct IO, what its limitations are, and what pitfalls to avoid during benchmarking. We will also look at the implementation to understand how all the promises of stability and compatibility were kept.</p>\n<p>Direct IO is reported to deliver amazing performance boosts in some deployments. Understanding how not to hold it wrong is a great first step to potentially unlocking that speed-up on your systems too!</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>and -<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/timetable/timetable-ZFS-Direct-IO.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/timetable/timetable-ZFS-Direct-IO.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>#zfs #benchmarking #freebsd</p>\n",

Another issue we identified is that University labs rarely teach problem-solving skills for a real-world scenario that students have to deal with in their post-academic working life (i.e. fixing production issues). Traditional assignments lacked real-world relevance (and were easily solved with the help of AI), leaving students unprepared for professional challenges in their later jobs. To address this, we developed as part of a master's thesis for University of Applied Sciences, Darmstadt, Germany a new teaching framework leveraging Chaos Engineering and Gamification elements to modernize Unix education on FreeBSD. With our new system, real-world problems can be simulated by instructors and allows students to use system administrator permissions to solve them. We also developed this system to make it difficult for participants to \"cheat\" using AI and evaluated the system towards that end with a group of students.</p>\n<p>This talk will introduce our new \"Chaos education system\" tested in the \"Unix for Software Developers\" course at the University. The name stems from the chaos monkey systems that intentionally \"wreak havoc\" on production systems to improve their resiliency and train the sysadmins managing them to find and fix them. Our approach lets instructors inject intentional faults (error scenarios) into student-managed FreeBSD jails. The students must then identify, resolve, and prevent these issues from occurring again using standard system administration tools, including root permissions. To increase student motivation to solve these scenarios quickly (and to create artificial \"production system is at stake\" pressure), a global highscore list is used as a gamification element: each time an issue is solved, points are awarded to that team based on the elapsed time and an instructor-defined difficulty bonus. A post-mortem group discussion with the instructor lets students talk through various ways of solving the issue, giving the group deeper insights on possible solutions each group had used. Using the system, the students gain practical skills like troubleshooting, system recovery, and proactive system management with real-world scenarios, something that traditional \"one size fits all\" assignments lack.</p>\n<p>We built the whole system using BSD-licensed open source components: FreeBSD, pf, VNET, bastille jails and templates. Shells scripts act as the glue to tie them together and implement the logic for the rest of the chaos monkey system. The prototype system has been tested with two student groups of 16 students each in January 2025. One group was allowed to use ChatGPT during the scenarios to see how AI-support helps them (if at all). Insights from this testing was used to enhance the system further.</p>\n<p>This talk will introduce the chaos education system idea, implementation, demonstrate its functionality, and discuss future work in this area. FreeBSD proved to be an excellent building platform for this system, due to its great modularity, open source, low resource overhead, and available documentation. The system can be enhanced further and used outside of an academic environment, like employee training or workshop-style challenges at events. It is easy for instructors to construct a custom scenario for participants and inject it into the training jails. The system can scale to a number of parallel users due to the lightweight nature that FreeBSD jails provide.</p>\n<p>Audience: Educators, trainers, and system administrators interested in modernizing Unix/Linux education through hands-on, interactive methods. Managers may find the system interesting for training their own employees by constructing scenarios mimicking their own environment.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>and -<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/timetable/timetable-Enhancing-Unix-Education.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/timetable/timetable-Enhancing-Unix-Education.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

In this presentation, I will discuss the reasons behind our decision, the technical and organizational challenges we faced, the tangible benefits we have experienced, and why we believe this migration is successful. I will provide specific examples and real-life case studies. In an increasingly complex world, relying on simple, stable, and secure solutions is becoming more and more important, and the BSDs can make a significant contribution in this direction.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>and -<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/timetable/timetable-Why-and-how.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/timetable/timetable-Why-and-how.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

(These are not BSD-specific topics, but the maturity of reasonable routing daemons in ports have meant that we can now do this without needing an upstream router).</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>and -<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/timetable/timetable-Running-a-root.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/timetable/timetable-Running-a-root.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
